#Overview of Project

##Purpose
Louise wants to start a crowdfunding campaign for her new play, fever. We will be analyzing a large data set to determine key characteristics to improve the likelihood of a successful campaign. 

##Analysis and Challenges
###Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Louise will be happy to know that the odds of a successful campaign are in her favour! There are consistently more successful campaigns than failed/cancelled ones. December is the only month where they come close to being equally as likely, so Louise should be sure to avoid launching her campaign in that month. In order to optimize her campaign, Louise should consider launching her campaign in the month of May, since that is when it most likely that her campaign will be successful.

###Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This analysis compares the outcomes of campaigns dependant on the amount of the fundraising goals. It should not come as a surprise to find out that the higher the fundraising goal, the less likely it is to be successful. Even though the trend inverses at $35,000 – $45,000 dollars, the sample size in that band is small enough that Louise should disregard this blip. Louise should think carefully about the appropriate fundraising goal to consider. She has budgeted her play to be $10,000 dollars and after running this analysis, it can be concluded that that is a realistic fundraising goal.

###Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Personally, it took me a while to get comfortable with the course routine. I assumed that I could just start the week as the module challenge but realized that the assignment includes all the work leading up throughout the module that week. I also ran into a company firewall when trying to submit this assignment, so I had to purchase a new laptop in time for Thursdays 11:59pm deadline.  I think this assignment would have been much harder if I didn’t already have experience with Excel. I am glad we started the course with excel basics, so that the course load isn’t too demanding while a routine is being established.  

##Results
1) The best month to launch a Kickstarter is May and the worst month to launch a Kickstarter is December
2) The lower the funding goal, the more likely it is to be successful
3) At the higher fundraising goal band’s the sample size becomes very small. This causes blips in the visualization. 
4) Louise may want to see how fundraising goals for plays were met depending on the geographical location. This may persuade her to launch
